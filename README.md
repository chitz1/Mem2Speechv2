# Mem2Speechv2
Handwriting Recognition Application to Speech for Android using Tensorflow. 
There is no need to add the Tensorflow dependencies manually as it is already done by gradle build.

The performance of the model is not yet good as it wasn't trained properly.
The partner project for this application is https://github.com/selcouthlyBlue/simplified_bi_lstm_ocr that trains the models.
